# Poster on PPG Industry Talk 
I was engaged in a virtual industry talk by PPG on data analytics, infrastructure, and SAP. It was inspiring to see how a global company turns complex data into actionable insights and drives innovation through technology. As a first-year student, it gave me a clearer perspective on how what we learn in class connects to real-world applications, and motivated me to explore a future in data and IT with more confidence.
